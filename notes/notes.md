# These are Just Rough Notes

1. Using espeak-ng instead of vanilla espeak for espeakup results in
a speakup which does not interrupt speech when control is pressed.

2. On one occasion, after `pacman -Syu`, nano and other editors
stopped working and gave a 'no window' error when opened. This this
was some kind of failure of ncurses and maybe readline in
combination. So test an editor after `pacman -Syu`.
