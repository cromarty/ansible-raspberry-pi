All code in this repository is copyright(R), 2018, Mike Ray,

Exceptions are some Ansible library code in `roles`. See the README.md
file in that directory for details.

## Sub-directories

* roles

Ansible roles.

* playbooks

Playbooks using the roles.


## Purpose

The use of the code in here is primarily to configure either Arch Linux or Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi.

Thre is an emphasis on accessibility, because I am totally blind.

The role and playbook combinations are capable of installing console mode screen readers, and the GTK Orca screen reader in any desktop that is supported herein.

Emacspeak, the 'complete audio desktop', is included.
