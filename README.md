Exceptions are some Ansible library code in `libraries`.

## Sub-directories

* roles

Ansible roles.

* playbooks

Playbooks using the roles.

* libraries

Libraries that are not part of Ansible, third-party libraries.

## Purpose

The use of the code in here is primarily to configure either Arch Linux or Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi.

There is an emphasis on accessibility, because I am totally blind.

The role and playbook combinations are capable of installing console mode screen readers, and the GTK Orca screen reader in any desktop that is supported herein.

Emacspeak, the 'complete audio desktop', is included.
